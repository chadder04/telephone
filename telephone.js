/*

  Each number on the telephone dial (except 0 and 1) corresponds to three alphabetic characters. Those correspondences are:
    2 ABC
    3 DEF
    4 GHI
    5 JKL
    6 MNO
    7 PRS
    8 TUV
    9 WXY

  Given a seven digit telephone number, print all 2187 possible "words" that number spells.
  (They may not be real english words, but just some sequence of characters).
  Since the digits 0 and 1 have no alphabetic equivalent, an input number which contains those digits should be rejected.
  The input will be one or more seven digit integers from standard input.
